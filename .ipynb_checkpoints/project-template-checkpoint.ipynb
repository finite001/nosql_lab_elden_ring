The company is known for creating very difficult Role Playing Games such as Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. Elden Ring follows this tradition of throwing bosses in your way that aim to humble you. \n",

There are famous streamers which will without a doubt have mentioned Elden Ring in their Tweets - Before, during and after the release of the game. Using the data 'users' which connect the tweets to the posters, I will be analyzing some of what these streamers said. "

    "Twitter API is special in numerous ways. It is not possible to simply call the request() function on an URL. At least not to get the data I want. Twitter usually only allows to extract tweets 14 days back. However, I have an academic account which gives me full archive access. But because Twitter only returns a max of 500 tweets per request, we have to call the API multiple times until no more tweets matching our search criteria are returned. For this, Twitter sends a token with each request which allows us to continue where we left off. We will look at tweets starting from 11 June 2019 - which is when Elden Ring was first announced - up to 10 May 2022. \n",
